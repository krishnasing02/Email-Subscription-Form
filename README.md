# Email-Subscription-Form
📩 Email Subscription Form (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)
A simple, functional email subscription form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The user enters their email, hits subscribe, and the data is pushed directly into a Google Form, which acts as the backend storage for all submissions.

🔧 What This Project Does
Takes user email input from the webpage
Validates the email before submitting
Sends the data to a Google Form using its POST endpoint
Lets you collect all subscriber emails inside Google Sheets without any backend server

🛠️ Tech Used
HTML for structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript for form validation + handling the request
Google Forms & Google Sheets as the data store

🚀 Why I Built This
I wanted a quick, lightweight way to collect user emails without setting up a backend or database. Google Forms provided a simple, reliable storage option, and the form handles the rest.
